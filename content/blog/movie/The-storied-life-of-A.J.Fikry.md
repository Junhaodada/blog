A.J. Fikry's wife has died, his bookstore is in trouble, and now his prized rare edition of Poe poems has been stolen. But when a mysterious package appears, its arrival gives him the chance to make his life over and see things anew. A NYT Bestseller.

世俗熙熙攘攘，唯有美酒与书籍能够引起人与人之间情感与心灵的共鸣，这是一个苦涩与美好并存的故事。当生活陷入困境之时，不妨拿起一本书，沉溺其中，未尝不是一种享受呢。

治愈自己的永远是内心极致的宁静。大胆追求所爱，寻找那份宁静。
